        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Poppy, and I'm a voice actor based in the UK! Alongside
          voice acting, some of my greatest passions include character concept
          art, singing, content creation and skateboarding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been voice acting for roughly thirteen years now, and I've always
          known it was my calling. I love how it makes me feel, the joy it
          brings me and how well I can tell a story. Voice acting was a passion
          raised to me after one of my favourite video games began openly
          casting for roles. I submitted an audition expecting nothing back. I
          now voice my favourite character in the game, which is one of my most
          proudest achievements to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          It helped me realise that nothing is off limits for me if I really set
          my mind to it. That's how voice acting became the biggest love in my
          life. I'm surrounded by the most wonderful and supportive friends in
          the world; named Mark, Millie and Sterre. They have helped me push
          forward through the tough moments both imposter syndrome and self
          doubt have brought me with this career, and I now feel nothing but
          excitement when being met with new opportunities. Not to mention my
          adoptive father, who is not only a voice actor, but my mentor. I would
          be nowhere near where I am today without his guidance!
        </p>
